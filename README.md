# jUtils
A general-purpose discord bot, that's written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Because you need a blazing fast bot for a chat platform.

## Features
It has some features that I remember to add.
### Leveling
> *"It's just the same old leveling bot"*, they say.

...but can your leveling bot do this?

Also I feel like almost all leveling bots has the same leveling card, so it has a different style leveling card.

[WIP]

## Cool, now where's that link that adds the bot on my server?
Woah there, slow down! jUtils is not a hosted bot and it never will.
That's because hosting a bot is really expensive and competing with some large bots will just not be economical.

You have 2 options of hosting jUtils:
### Using Docker
Download the [.cfg/Config.toml]() file and the [.src/]

### Hosting it on bare metal
Go to the [Releases](/releases/latest) page and select the appropriate build for your OS. Note that we don't support 32-bit anymore, then unzip it, and put the config file on the same folder of the files, and also install MongoDB and configure it.

### Note: Work in progress!
